    - degree: MSc in Computer Science
      university: Stony Brook University
      time: 2018 - Present
      details: |
        I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science from Stony Brook University. 
        My interests lies in systems domain mainly on file systems and compilers. I am also interested
        in building large scale distributed systems. Below are the courses I have taken.
          - Advanced Compiler Design
          - Computer Graphics
          - Network Security

    - degree: BTech in Computer Science and Engineering
      university: Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur
      time: 2011 - 2015
      details: |
        I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur(IIT KGP) with Honors in Computer Science and Engineering.
        Professor Sudeb Prashant Pal has advised me on my thesis "Local Computation in Hypergraph Bicoloring". Some of the 
        courses that I have taken during my undergrduate course are listed below.
          - Operation Systems
          - Distributed Systems
          - Computer Architecture
          - Compiler Design

experiences:
    - role: Member of Technical Staff
      time: Nov 2015 - Aug 2018
      company: Edge Verve Systems
      details: |
        During my time at Edgeverve I have worked with various techologies and products. The important one is the
        "oe-workflow", which is a BPMN 2.0 (Business Process Management Notation) execution engine. Business process 
        are complictaed with relations to other processes and so the BPMN was introduced to easily design and deploy these
        processes. This closes the gap between the managers who know these processes and developers who have to build them.
        "oe-workflow" takes a workflow drawn according to BPMN 2.0 standards and executes it with the given set of constraints.
        It has been develkoped as an alternative to Redhat jBPM and Activity workflow executors. It helps in reducing a cost of 
        100K USD every year interms of support costs.  
          - Nodejs
          - Loopback
          - MongoDB 

    - role: Consultant
      time: Aug 2015 - Nov 2015
      company: EXL
      details: |
        I worked on developing a subscription model to predict the flow of user subscriptions to an entertainmnet website.
        Developed the prototype in SAAS and delivered the product in Python and Amazon Redshift.
          - Python 
          - SAAS 
    - role: Research Intern
      time: May 2014 - Jul 2014
      company: IDRBT
      details: |
        I worked on developing a novel process to store fingerprints which is a domain of cancelable biomterics. The goal of
        the project is to develop a system which can transform fingerprints one way and any adversary who tries to recreate the 
        original fingerprint should fail. The same system should also work for authentication and identification using fingerprints.
        This is similar to hashing passwords instead of using plain text while storing or using for authentication of a user.
